It seems kind of strange and unfare, as if tips a mandatory they have to be included in the ride price and not ask from the passenger, especcially in case you do not want to give tips you can be rejected from the ride, which definetely not fare.

The dataset doesn't have any data about tips for cash transaction, and the card transaction incuded tips by default, so we can try to create model, which predicts type of payment (cash or card), but as we have 6 different payment type although with cash or card prevailed, it may be problematic.

    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "    I would not recommend to use this model, as its score not really impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Based on the feature importance model splitted the data and continue spleting until it reaches its leaf with the final decision. Each decision can be investigate with plot_tree function. The most important feture is VendorID, following by predicted fare\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "    We can investigate the weather condition, it can be useful here     \n",
    "    As for engeneering additional feature, we can come up with smth new, although we pretty much all main features in the list at the moment\n",

    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Weather condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
